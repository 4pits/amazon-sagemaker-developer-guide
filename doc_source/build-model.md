# Build a Model<a name="build-model"></a>

To build a machine learning model in Amazon SageMaker, you have the following options:
+ Use one of the built\-in algorithims\. Amazon SageMaker provides several built\-in machine learning algorithms that you can use for a variety of problem types\. For more information, see [Use Amazon SageMaker Built\-in Algorithms ](algos.md)\.
+ Write a custom training script in a machine learning framework that Amazon SageMaker supports, and use one of the pre\-built framework containers to run it in Amazon SageMaker\. For information, see [Use Machine Learning Frameworks with Amazon SageMaker](frameworks.md)\.
+ Build your own container to run your training and inference code in Amazon SageMaker\. For information, see [Use Your Own Algorithms with Amazon SageMaker](your-algorithms.md)\.
+ Use an algorithm that you subscribe to from AWS Marketplace\. For information, see [Amazon SageMaker Resources in AWS Marketplace](sagemaker-marketplace.md)\.
